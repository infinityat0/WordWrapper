This is a repository containing chromeriver problem solution. The input file added is file.txt and output file is file.out.txt. Also added are WordWrapper.class and WordWrapper.java files. 

To compile/build your own file copy WordWrapper.java into a folder and navigate to the folder in terminal. Then run the following commands. 
$ > cd 'folderWhereWordWrapper.javaIsPresent'
$ > javac WordWrapper.java
$ > java WordWrapper.java 'fullpathOfInputFile' 'fullPathOfOutputFile'

This will compile the program and run it. Attached are the sample input and output files. The output file maintains 'space' in the new lines. This is done on purpose to maintain character seperation in the event of replacing all new lines with blank spaces.
